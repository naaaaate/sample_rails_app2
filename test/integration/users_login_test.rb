# we need a test to capture the sequence shown in Figure 8.5 and Figure 8.6. The basic steps appear as follows:
# Visit the login path.
# Verify that the new sessions form renders properly.
# Post to the sessions path with an invalid params hash.
# Verify that the new sessions form gets re-rendered and that a flash message appears.
# Visit another page (such as the Home page).
# Verify that the flash message doesnâ€™t appear on the new page.

  #   # no user data in db.. so create fixtures for tests.. in our test-fixtures-users.yml

  #     # then set our session hash here to @user.email and string "password"

  #   assert_select "a[href=?]", logout_path

  #   # should log user out
  #   delete logout_path
